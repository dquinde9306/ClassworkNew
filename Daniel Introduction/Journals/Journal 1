	My current goal for the day is to research how computers connect to each other over a network and hopefully
	find out how I can begin to do this using java. I will also be setting up the power point for the presentation.

	I have been able to find all of the resources necessary for me to make the chatroom. My hope for 
	tomorrow will be to start the creation of the server and client. Using the resources that I have found, I 
	doubt it will be too complicated.

	Today I was able to start the creation of the server as well as get a better understanding of how sockets 
	and connections work in Java. On Monday, I will continue creating the server and later work on the client side but 
	I doubt that I will get that far.
